Differences in the program compared to Rules As Written

*** SETTLEMENT TYPE ***
Rules say this should be GM decision.  There is a "Select" button for that, however I've added a "Rand" button
I've then made up a random selection process (see in the RandomPlanet.cs)

*** COLONY POPULATION ***
Rather than using the table, I'm essentially backing out the table from some Species parameters
Basically rebuilding the table in code as per the breakout box on Space page 93

*** LIMITS ***
Some limits can be breached on user inputs.  For example, on the random table planets can only get resources in the range (-2,+2)
The user input screen I've done however just has a note on this, and permits the user to select any value (-5,+5)
I could have limited the planet option list, however chose to permit the wider range
Other things, such as physical planetary characteristics, I've retained the limits to ensure results are reasonable
